## Executive Summary 

Open-source technologies can help India achieve techno-strategic autonomy, economic growth, technology leadership, and skill development. Transparency and inclusivity also help foster trust, broaden access to technology, and further democratic values.

We recommend a range of policy initiatives for software, hardware and standards that will nurture a sustainable open-source technology ecosystem.


### Software

- Adopt Open Standards, Open Protocols and Networks and Open Ecosystems
- Adopt an open-source first policy in government procurement 
- Establish an open source programme office to coordinate policies, use and contribution of open source software (OSS) across government bodies
- Inculcate OSS skills in the education curriculum
- Fund existing open-source projects of interest to the government and public
- Mandate acknowledgement of OSS Use


### Hardware

- Co-create robust open-source hardware products with like-minded partners 
- Award grants for open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tools
- Open-Source the process design kit (PDK) of government research fabs
- Implement a durability index for electrical and electronic products


### Standards

- Promote the adoption of open standards
- Participate actively in standards development organisations (SDOs)
- Facilitate the development of open standards
